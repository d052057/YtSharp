This app is based on youtubeDlSharp which is usiong yt-dlp.exe and ffmeg.exe to download and convert sources to desired output.  
The app is from the wpf demo and coverted to web base app with the help of ChatGPT.

Tried to use Claude.ai but the code is not desired since it converted to Microsoft MVC plateform.

This app works well (it download videos from cut and pasted from many videos websites and the support of yt-dlp.exe.  However, I can not get the angular
app to get responses from server side which runs the yt-dlp.exe.

I believe that this issue can be corrected since I have seen application that obtains the progress from server side but unfortunately, I am new to Angular and dotnet (ver 9).

Thanks.
