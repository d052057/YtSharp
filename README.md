This app is based on youtubeDlSharp which is using yt-dlp.exe and ffmeg.exe to download and convert video sources to desired output.  
The app is from the youtubeDLSharp wpf demo file and it has been coverted to web base app with the help of ChatGPT.

Tried to use Claude.ai but the code is not desired since it converted to Microsoft MVC plateform.

This app works well (it download videos.  However, I can not get the angular app to get responses from server side which runs the yt-dlp.exe.

I believe that this issue can be corrected by Angular expertees since I have seen application that obtains the progress from server side ( unfortunately, I am new to Angular and dotnet9).

Thanks.
